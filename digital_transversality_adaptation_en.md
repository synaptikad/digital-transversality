# Digital Transversality for Existing Building Adaptation v2.0

## Methodology and ontology for coherent transformation of existing built environments

# 1. INTRODUCTION TO THE APPROACH

## 1.1 Conceptual foundations

Digital Transversality applied to the adaptation of existing buildings constitutes a structured methodological approach that aims to establish complete coherence between the initial intentions of a transformation project and its concrete materialization, taking into account the specific constraints and opportunities of already installed infrastructure. This method particularly focuses on optimizing the performance of built environments throughout their life cycle, by natively integrating dimensions of circularity and evolvability, while valorizing existing material and informational heritage.

This approach is based on five structuring principles adapted to the context of existing buildings:

1. **Informational continuity**: Traditionally, the construction industry operates through compartmentalized phases with significant informational breaks between each of them. In the context of existing buildings, these breaks are exacerbated by the heterogeneity of documentation, often fragmentary and unstructured. Digital Transversality establishes an uninterrupted flow of information that begins with the recovery and structuring of existing information, then continues with their progressive enrichment, thus eliminating re-entries and information losses that are sources of errors and inefficiencies.

2. **Primacy of intention**: Unlike conventional approaches that often begin with material considerations, this methodology places intentions and requirements as the absolute starting point, even in an adaptation context. The clear definition of expected capabilities allows guiding adaptation choices and evolution of existing infrastructure. Each modification or conservation of material element must be justified by a clearly formalized intention, thus ensuring that concrete realizations effectively respond to initial objectives.

3. **Evolutionary adaptability**: Existing built environments are reconceptualized not as fixed structures to be radically transformed, but as organisms to be evolved progressively and coherently. This vision recognizes that uses change, technologies evolve and needs transform. Adaptability becomes the guiding thread of interventions to maximize the functional lifespan of existing infrastructure.

4. **Circular logic**: Circularity takes on a particular dimension in the adaptation of existing buildings. Beyond the reuse of external materials, it integrates the valorization of equipment and systems already in place. Each existing element is evaluated in terms of its potential for reuse, adaptation or valorization at end of life. Circularity becomes a determining criterion in choices of conservation, adaptation or replacement.

5. **Double contextualization**: The method is based on simultaneous and connected modeling of immaterial dimensions (intentions, requirements, capabilities) and material dimensions (existing spatial context, devices in place, components to be conserved or adapted). This duality allows establishing complete traceability between the "why" of desired transformations and the "how" of adaptations to be realized, taking into account the constraints and opportunities of the existing.

### 1.1.6 The informational approach as methodological foundation

The multidimensional complexity of adaptation projects exceeds our natural cognitive capacity. An existing building adaptation project involves thousands of interdependent variables: system conditions, future needs, technical constraints, environmental, economic, social and generative impacts. This complexity is comparable to what a two-dimensional being would have in conceiving a three-dimensional object: we cannot directly apprehend these high-dimensional spaces.

Computing then becomes crucial not as a simple tool, but as a **conceptual language** allowing to:
- Navigate multidimensional analysis spaces
- Model complex interdependencies between variables
- Project this complexity in intelligible form for decision-making
- Reveal synergies and optimizations invisible to traditional analysis

This informational approach allows transforming the adaptation of existing buildings from an empirical process into a rigorous systemic approach.

### Specific challenges of existing buildings

The adaptation of existing buildings presents particular challenges that Digital Transversality must address:

- **Variable and heterogeneous state of infrastructure**: Existing buildings present great technological diversity, with systems installed at different periods, according to varied standards and with often incomplete documentation. This heterogeneity requires a methodological approach capable of integrating and harmonizing disparate elements.

- **Sectorial organization and technical fragmentation**: The organization of existing buildings by technical specialties (electricity, HVAC, safety, computer networks) has historically generated information silos and coordination difficulties that the adaptation project must overcome to achieve a coherent systemic vision.

- **Growing regulatory complexity**: Faced with the explosion of regulatory requirements, many existing building managers struggle to clearly express their adaptation needs, guarantee compliance and make informed choices for the transformation of their heritage.

- **Growing imperative for CSR and environmental performance**: Existing buildings constitute the essential part of the real estate stock and must be adapted to meet new global performance requirements, without necessarily benefiting from the advantages of an optimized initial design.

## 1.2 Operational methodological principles for adaptation

The operationalization of Digital Transversality in the context of existing buildings is based on four fundamental technical mechanisms, adapted to the specificities of this context:

1. **Extended atomic traceability**: This principle establishes an uninterrupted guiding thread between each element of the project, from the most abstract strategic intention to the most concrete physical component, whether existing, adapted or new. Each element possesses a unique identifier and clearly defined relationships with other elements, allowing navigation in both directions (from intention to realization or vice versa). For existing buildings, this traceability is enriched by a temporal dimension that documents the history of equipment and systems, their current state and their evolution trajectory. This extended traceability guarantees overall coherence and allows verifying alignment between adaptation objectives and material solutions implemented.

2. **Adaptive double contextualization**: The parallel and connected modeling of the immaterial world (intentions, requirements, capabilities) and the existing material world (spatial context, devices and systems in place, components) allows unprecedented flexibility. This double perspective particularly facilitates the adaptation of spaces to different uses without necessarily radically modifying their physical structure (chronotopy), as well as the evolution of technical solutions without losing sight of the functional requirements they must satisfy. In the context of adaptation, it allows precisely mapping the current capabilities of the building and identifying gaps with target capabilities.

3. **Continuous assessment of transformation impacts**: From the first strategic adaptation decisions, a multi-criteria analysis evaluates environmental, economic, social and generative consequences over the entire life cycle. This evaluation is progressively refined as the project becomes more precise, allowing informed arbitrations at each stage. For existing buildings, it specifically integrates the evaluation of impacts related to conservation, adaptation or replacement of systems in place, with particular attention to valorizing the existing.

4. **Adaptive and integrative technical solutions**: The model allows different material implementations to respond to the same functional requirements, while favoring integration with existing systems when relevant. This non-deterministic approach offers flexibility that allows conserving and valorizing viable existing equipment, adapting partially functional systems, and integrating new elements coherently. The emphasis is on functional compatibility and progressive interoperability rather than fixed technical solutions or systematic replacements.

## 1.3 Concrete benefits for adaptation of existing buildings

# 2. DIGITAL TRANSVERSALITY ONTOLOGY FOR ADAPTATION

## 2.1 Fundamental conceptual structure adapted to existing buildings

The Digital Transversality ontology applied to existing buildings simultaneously models the immaterial world (intentional) and the existing material world (physical), connected by precisely defined pivot concepts. This structure is enriched to capture the specificities of adaptation, notably the current state, history and evolution trajectory of physical elements.

### 2.1.1 Immaterial world (intentional)

This dimension remains structurally similar to the original approach, but particularly focuses on defining requirements and target capabilities in an adaptation context:

**Requirements**: These elements represent the structured formalization of adaptation needs arising from strategic intentions. They constitute the highest level of the functional hierarchy and are divided into several categories:

- **Regulatory requirements**: Legal and normative obligations applicable to the existing building (accessibility compliance, fire safety, updated energy performance, etc.)
- **Voluntary requirements**: Certifications, labels and standards that the adaptation project wishes to achieve (HQE Operation, BREEAM In-Use, LEED O+M, WELL, etc.)
- **Natural requirements**: Intrinsic functional needs arising from the evolution of planned uses (thermal comfort adapted to new uses, acoustic, visual, etc.)
- **Circular requirements**: Specifically related to valorization of the existing, reuse and circular economy (valorization of equipment in place, dismantlability of new elements, etc.)

**Target capabilities**: Target capabilities are the aptitudes that the adapted building must offer to satisfy requirements. They represent an intermediate level of abstraction between general requirements and concrete means to satisfy them. In the context of adaptation, they are defined to facilitate their comparison with current capabilities of the existing building. They are divided into two main categories:

- **Target dynamic capabilities**: These capabilities require active information exchanges and regulation or command processes. They generally involve a temporal dimension and information processing (e.g., adaptive thermal regulation, intelligent presence detection).
- **Target static capabilities**: These capabilities rely on passive physical properties, which do not involve dynamic information exchanges (e.g., reinforced acoustic insulation, updated structural resistance).

**Functions**: Functions are atomic actions that decline dynamic capabilities into elementary and indivisible operations. They constitute the most granular level of the dynamic immaterial world. Each function:

- Uses or accesses a data point
- Represents a precise and well-defined action (e.g., measure a temperature, command a lighting level)
- Can be associated with specific performance criteria

**Attributes**: Attributes are the required characteristics that decline static capabilities into measurable properties. They constitute the most granular level of the static immaterial world. Each attribute:

- Is materialized by one or more material characteristics
- Possesses precise and measurable target values (e.g., minimum passage width, fire resistance)
- Can be validated by documentary proofs

### 2.1.2 Existing material world (physical)

This dimension is considerably enriched to capture the reality of the existing building:

**Existing spatial context**: This hierarchical structure represents the current physical organization of the building's spaces. It constitutes the spatial framework in which adaptations will be embodied. The existing spatial context is documented at different scales:

- **Territories (multi-level)**: From broad territory to parcel
- **Building**: The complete built envelope with its current characteristics
- **Level**: The different floors or existing vertical subdivisions
- **Space**: The different rooms or functional zones in their current configuration

**Existing devices**: Existing devices are material functional entities already in place in the building. They represent systems that:

- Possess a qualified functional state (operational, degraded, obsolete, etc.)
- Expose or can expose data points
- Are composed of several physical components
- Constitute the basic functional unit of the existing material world
- Examples: current lighting system, HVAC system in place, existing access control

**Functional state**: This notion specific to adaptation qualifies the current operational condition of each device:

- **Fully functional**: Operational device conforming to original specifications
- **Partially functional**: Operational device but with degraded performance
- **Non-functional**: Out-of-service device but physically present
- **Obsolete**: Functional device but no longer meeting current requirements
- **Inadequate**: Functional device but incompatible with new target capabilities

**Existing components**: Components are the material constituent elements of existing devices. They represent the most granular level of the physical world and:

- Possess measurable technical characteristics
- Have a documented conservation state
- Possess specific circularity and adaptation characteristics
- Are the elements on which concrete technical adaptation choices bear
- Examples: current luminaire, existing valve, detector in place, panel, frame

**Existing communicating equipment**: These elements currently facilitate data communication between the physical world and the digital world. They:

- Allow data points to transit to digital infrastructure
- Can serve several devices simultaneously
- Ensure gateway between different protocols
- Examples: existing BACnet controller, DALI/IP gateway in place, installed IoT concentrator

### 2.1.3 Junction elements and key relationships for adaptation

**Existing data points**: They constitute the interface between immaterial functions and existing material devices. Each data point:

- Is exposed by a specific existing device
- Can be used by current functions
- Transits through an existing communicating equipment
- Possesses a defined data type and precision
- Examples: currently measured temperature, available dimming level, detected occupancy state

**Characteristics**: These are measurable properties of existing components that:

- Materialize currently available attributes
- Are validated by documentary proofs (when they exist)
- Allow evaluating adequacy between future needs and existing solutions
- Examples: CRI of a light source in place, width of an existing door, current thermal resistance

**Proofs**: Tangible elements of characteristic validation that can take the form of:

- Existing technical documents (product sheets, test reports, as-built drawings)
- Existing certifications and labels
- Measurements and readings performed during audit
- Inspection and maintenance reports

**Capabilities gaps vs existing**: Pivot concept specific to adaptation that:

- Identifies differences between target capabilities and current capabilities
- Quantifies the magnitude of necessary adaptations
- Qualifies the nature of required interventions (conservation, adaptation, replacement)
- Serves as basis for developing the adaptation plan

**Adaptation plan**: Formalization of interventions to be carried out that:

- Precisely defines operations by device and component
- Prioritizes interventions according to their impact and urgency
- Plans implementation phases
- Establishes interfaces between conserved, adapted and new elements

### 2.1.4 Zones and chronotopy applied to adaptation

**Zones**: The concept of zone takes on a particular dimension in the context of adaptation:

- **Current zones**: Mapping of current usage zones of the building
- **Target zones**: Definition of projected usage zones after adaptation
- **Transition zones**: Identification of zones requiring progressive transformation
- **Critical zones**: Spaces requiring priority or complex interventions

**Adaptive chronotopy**: This approach allows:

- Analysis of current usage variations and anticipation of future evolutions
- Planning of progressive transformations without exploitation interruption
- Temporary cohabitation between existing systems and new systems
- Gradual adaptation of spaces to new uses

## 2.2 Modeling circularity, adaptation characteristics and impacts

### 2.2.1 Circularity and adaptation characteristics

Circularity characteristics are enriched in the adaptation context to encompass valorization of the existing:

**Reusability**:

- **Extended definition**: Capacity of an existing component to be reused in its original function or in a new function, without or with minor transformation
- **Measurement**: Score from 0 to 10 on a standardized and documented scale
- **Enriched evaluation criteria**: Conservation state, aging resistance, compatibility with new systems, interface standardization
- **Example**: An existing luminaire with score 8/10 indicates it is in good condition, compatible with new controllers, and can be conserved in its current use or reassigned to another space

**Adaptability**:

- **Extended definition**: Capacity of an existing device to be modified to meet new requirements without complete replacement
- **Measurement**: Score from 0 to 10 on standardized scale
- **Enriched evaluation criteria**: Component modularity, upgrade possibility, compatibility with new protocols, intrinsic evolvability
- **Example**: An existing HVAC system with score 7/10 can be equipped with new intelligent controllers and sensors without replacement of main mechanical elements

**Dismantlability**:

- **Unchanged definition**: Ease with which a component can be separated from its assembly without damage to itself or adjacent elements
- **Measurement**: Score from 0 to 10 on standardized scale
- **Evaluation criteria**: Type of fixing, accessibility, necessary tools, dismantling time
- **Example**: An existing partition with score 9/10 uses only mechanical assemblies without glue or welding, with easily accessible connectors requiring only standard tools

**Recyclability**:

- **Unchanged definition**: Potential for transformation into secondary raw material at end of life cycle
- **Measurement**: Recyclable percentage and identification of available channels
- **Evaluation criteria**: Material homogeneity, separation ease, existence of channels
- **Example**: An existing aluminum frame 90% recyclable via an existing and well-documented channel

**Integration with new systems (specific to adaptation)**:

- **Definition**: Capacity of an existing component to function with new systems and protocols
- **Measurement**: Score from 0 to 10 on standardized scale
- **Evaluation criteria**: Protocol compatibility, possibility of interface addition, standardization
- **Example**: An existing actuator with score 6/10 can be integrated into new systems via an adaptation gateway

### 2.2.2 Enriched structure of adaptation impacts

Adaptation impacts are evaluated according to four fundamental dimensions, each adapted to the context of transforming an existing building and oriented toward sustainable human flourishing:

#### Economic Impacts (temporalized)
Temporal hierarchical structure allowing complete life cycle vision:

- **CAPEX (Capital Expenditure)**: Initial investment costs
  - Adaptation study and design costs
  - Realization/transformation costs
  - Commissioning and integration costs

- **OPEX (Operational Expenditure)**: Operating costs
  - Modified energy consumptions
  - Adaptive maintenance and upkeep
  - Optimized management and operation

- **FINEX (Final Expenditure)**: End-of-life costs
  - Facilitated dismantling/deconstruction
  - Valorization/recycling of adapted components
  - Restoration for new adaptation

#### Environmental Impacts (living regeneration)
Focus on positive contribution to ecosystems:

- **Climate**: Climatic balances
  - Differential GHG emissions (conservation vs new)
  - Additional carbon sequestration
  - Reinforced climate resilience

Direct evaluation of contribution to universal values:

Each value is measured according to its specific sub-dimensions:

1. **Health** (physical and mental)
   - Physical vitality, mental balance, psychic flourishing

2. **Peace** (in all its forms)
   - Personal serenity, social harmony, ecological balance, geopolitical stability

3. **Trust** (security and reliability)
   - Physical security, technical reliability, social predictability

4. **Friendship** (authentic bonds)
   - Relationship quality, mutual aid, sense of belonging

5. **Knowledge** (learning and meaning)
   - Knowledge acquisition, creativity, search for meaning

6. **Freedom** (autonomy and dignity)
   - Freedom of choice, action autonomy, respected dignity

7. **Beauty** (aesthetics and harmony)
   - Form harmony, spiritual elevation, creative inspiration

8. **Justice** (equity and solidarity)
   - Equal opportunities, active solidarity, imbalance repair

### 2.2.3 Modeling interdependencies and co-benefits

#### Principle of intersectoral synergies
Each improvement in one dimension generates benefits in other dimensions. Digital Transversality quantifies these **co-benefits** often invisible in traditional analyses.

#### Dynamic correlation matrix
```json
{
  "impact_correlations": {
    "physical_health_to_economic": {
      "coefficient": 0.32,
      "activation_delay": 3,
      "effect_duration": 24,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "mechanism": "Health improvement → Productivity → Savings",
      "context": ["offices", "collaborative_spaces"]
    },
    "social_cohesion_to_security": {
      "coefficient": 0.18,
      "activation_delay": 12,
      "effect_duration": 60,
      "confidence": 0.60,
      "mechanism": "Cohesion → Incivility reduction → Security cost reduction"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Examples of impact cascades
**Air quality improvement**:
1. **Direct**: Respiratory problem reduction (-15%)
2. **Mental health**: Cognitive capacity (+12%)
3. **Social**: Absenteeism reduction (+8%)
4. **Economic**: Productivity gains (+€180k/year/200 people)
5. **Generative**: Environmental trust (+25%)

### 2.2.4 Impact evaluation by life cycle phase

Impact evaluation in the adaptation context takes into account different phases specific to transforming an existing building:

```
┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This multidimensional and multiphase analysis allows:

- Evaluating specific impacts of conservation, adaptation or replacement of existing systems
- Identifying optimal balances between maintaining existing and introducing new elements
- Quantifying real benefits of reuse and adaptation strategies across all phases
- Taking into account disruptions related to transformation phase on operation

## 2.3 Examples of influence relationships in adaptation context

The relationships between circularity/adaptation characteristics and impacts are multiple. Here are some concrete examples particularly relevant for existing buildings:

**Reusability (existing component) → Environmental impacts adaptation phase**:

- An existing component with high reusability (score 8+) allows avoiding 80-95% of the carbon footprint that its replacement would have generated
- This characteristic results in an equivalent decrease in demolition/construction waste
- The effect is particularly significant for complex technical equipment with high added value
- Example: Conservation of existing air handling units (after simple control replacement) can avoid 15-20 tons of CO₂ equivalent per unit

**Adaptability → Economic exploitation impacts**:

- High adaptability (score 8+) allows reducing adaptation costs by 50-70% compared to replacement
- It also reduces operational disruptions during the transformation phase
- This characteristic increases the possibility of progressive upgrading, optimizing investments
- Example: An adaptable existing lighting system can be modernized (new controllers, sensors) for 30% of complete replacement cost, while achieving 80% of target performance

**Integration with new systems → Social impacts**:

- Strong integration capacity (score 8+) allows improving user experience without complete material replacement
- It facilitates progressive introduction of new functionalities without disrupting habits
- This characteristic favors user appropriation of new capabilities
- Example: Existing access control terminals integrated into new management infrastructure improve user experience without changing badges or usage habits

**Dismantlability → Generative impacts**:

- High dismantlability of existing components (score 8+) facilitates adaptation to new uses
- It increases space flexibility and their capacity to evolve with needs
- This characteristic preserves component value for future reuse
- Example: Existing easily dismantlable partitions can be reconfigured to create collaborative spaces, increasing premises attractiveness without heavy work

## 2.4 JSON-LD structure of ontology adapted to existing buildings

The Digital Transversality ontology for adaptation is formalized in JSON-LD, with specific extensions to capture dimensions of existing, audit and adaptation:

# 4. GAP ANALYSIS AND ADAPTATION PROCESS

## 4.1 Systematic gap analysis methodology

The gap analysis methodology between existing and target needs constitutes one of the fundamental pillars of Digital Transversality for adaptation. It allows precisely determining necessary and optimal interventions.

### 4.1.1 Fundamental principles of gap analysis

Gap analysis is based on several structuring principles:

**Multidimensional approach**:
- Gaps are analyzed according to several dimensions: functional, technical, regulatory, social and environmental
- Each dimension is evaluated independently then crossed to obtain a holistic vision
- Prioritization takes into account all dimensions and their interdependencies

**Progressive granularity**:
- Analysis begins with a global vision of the building-system
- It then declines by functional domain (energy, comfort, security...)
- Then descends to specific device level
- To finish at individual component level
- Each level enriches the previous without losing overall vision

**Dual existing/target perspective**:
- Existing analysis: precise characterization of current state and available capabilities
- Target definition: clear and measurable formalization of desired capabilities
- Systematic confrontation to identify differentials
- Documentation of both perspectives to ensure traceability

**Quantified evaluation**:
- Objective measurement of gaps when possible (measurable performance)
- Standardized evaluation scales for qualitative aspects
- Metrics adapted to each gap type
- Clear visualization of gap amplitudes

### 4.1.2 Structured categorization of gaps

To facilitate analysis and decision-making, gaps are categorized according to several complementary typologies:

**According to functional nature**:

- **Performance gaps**: Capabilities exist but their performance is insufficient
  - *Example*: An existing ventilation system with insufficient flow for new needs
  - *Metric*: Percentage gap between current and target performance

- **Functional gaps**: Required capabilities are totally absent
  - *Example*: Absence of presence detection capability for regulation
  - *Metric*: Binary scale (presence/absence) or coverage degree

- **Technological gaps**: Technologies in place are obsolete but functional
  - *Example*: Technical management system on closed proprietary protocol
  - *Metric*: Technological maturity score and obsolescence degree

- **Regulatory gaps**: Non-compliance with current regulations
  - *Example*: Insufficient thermal insulation regarding standards in force
  - *Metric*: Compliance degree and regulatory criticality

- **Usage gaps**: Inadequacy with new user needs
  - *Example*: Spatial configuration incompatible with new work modes
  - *Metric*: Adequacy score to expressed needs

**According to magnitude of necessary transformation**:

- **Minor gaps**: Light adjustments without structural modification
  - *Example*: Regulation setpoint reparameterization
  - *Metric*: Effort level and intervention complexity (1-2/10)

- **Moderate gaps**: Partial adaptations requiring targeted modifications
  - *Example*: Sensor addition on existing system
  - *Metric*: Effort level and intervention complexity (3-5/10)

- **Major gaps**: Important transformations with partial conservation
  - *Example*: System overhaul with conservation of main infrastructures
  - *Metric*: Effort level and intervention complexity (6-8/10)

- **Critical gaps**: Near-total replacement necessary
  - *Example*: System fundamentally incompatible with new needs
  - *Metric*: Effort level and intervention complexity (9-10/10)

**According to characteristics of existing components**:

- **Gaps on high reusability components**: High conservation potential
  - *Example*: Metal structure in good condition easily adaptable
  - *Metric*: Reusability score (7-10/10)

- **Gaps on partially adaptable components**: Requiring modifications
  - *Example*: HVAC systems with partial regulation replacement
  - *Metric*: Adaptability score (4-6/10)

- **Gaps on difficultly adaptable components**: High replacement probability
  - *Example*: Closed monobloc systems without intervention possibility
  - *Metric*: Low reusability score (1-3/10)
