# **Digital Transversality**

## **Methodology and ontology for a coherent and performant built environment**

# **1. INTRODUCTION TO THE APPROACH**

## **1.1 Conceptual foundations**

Digital Transversality constitutes a structured methodological approach that aims to establish complete coherence between the initial intentions of a project and its concrete materialization. This method is particularly focused on optimizing the performance of built environments throughout their entire lifecycle, by natively integrating dimensions of circularity and evolvability.

This approach is based on five structuring principles:

1. **Informational continuity**: Traditionally, the construction industry operates in compartmentalized phases (programming, design, implementation, operation) with significant informational breaks between each of them. Digital Transversality establishes an uninterrupted and progressively enriched information flow, eliminating data re-entry and information losses that are sources of errors and inefficiencies.

2. **Primacy of intention**: Unlike conventional approaches that often begin with material considerations, this methodology places intentions and requirements as the absolute starting point. The clear definition of expected capabilities allows guiding technical choices. Each material element must be justified by a clearly formalized intention, thus ensuring that concrete realizations effectively respond to initial objectives.

3. **Evolutionary adaptability**: Built environments are designed not as fixed structures, but as organisms capable of evolving over time. This vision recognizes that uses change, technologies evolve, and needs transform. Adaptability thus becomes the guiding thread of interventions to maximize the functional lifespan of infrastructures.

4. **Circular logic**: Reuse and circularity are not considerations added a posteriori but fundamental dimensions integrated from the first conceptual phases. Each choice is evaluated according to its potential for reusability, dismantlability, recyclability, and future adaptability.

5. **Double contextualization**: The method relies on simultaneous and connected modeling of immaterial dimensions (intentions, requirements, capabilities) and material dimensions (spatial context, devices, components). This duality enables establishing complete traceability between the "why" of desired transformations and the "how" of adaptations to be realized.

### **1.1.6 The informational approach as methodological foundation**

The multidimensional complexity of construction projects exceeds our natural cognitive capacity. A built environment project involves thousands of interdependent variables: future needs, technical constraints, environmental, economic, social, and generative impacts. This complexity is comparable to what a two-dimensional being would have in conceiving a three-dimensional object: we cannot directly apprehend these high-dimensional spaces.

Computing then becomes crucial not as a simple tool, but as a **conceptual language** enabling:
- Navigation in multidimensional analysis spaces
- Modeling complex interdependencies between variables
- Projecting this complexity in intelligible form for decision-making
- Revealing synergies and optimizations invisible to traditional analysis

This informational approach allows transforming the design of built environments from an empirical process into a rigorous systemic approach.

## **1.2 Operational methodological principles**

The operationalization of Digital Transversality relies on four fundamental technical mechanisms:

1. **Atomic traceability**: This principle establishes an uninterrupted guiding thread between each element of the project, from the most abstract strategic intention to the most concrete physical component. Each element possesses a unique identifier and clearly defined relationships with other elements, allowing navigation in both directions (from intention to realization or inversely). This traceability guarantees global coherence and allows verifying alignment between initial objectives and material solutions.

2. **Double contextualization**: The parallel and connected modeling of the immaterial world (intentions, requirements, capabilities) and the material world (spatial context, devices, components) allows unprecedented flexibility. This double perspective notably facilitates adaptation of spaces to different uses without necessarily modifying their physical structure (chronotopy), as well as evolution of technical solutions without losing sight of the functional requirements they must satisfy.

3. **Continuous impact evaluation**: From the first strategic decisions, a multi-criteria analysis evaluates environmental, economic, social, and generative consequences throughout the entire lifecycle. This evaluation is progressively refined as the project becomes more precise, enabling informed arbitration at each stage. Circularity characteristics (reusability, dismantlability, recyclability, adaptability) are systematically measured and their influence on different impacts is modeled.

4. **Adaptive technical solutions**: The model allows different material implementations to respond to the same functional requirements. This non-deterministic approach offers flexibility that allows adapting to available resources (notably in reuse), integrating technical innovations, and maximizing future adaptability. Emphasis is placed on functional compatibility rather than fixed technical solutions.

## **1.3 Concrete benefits**

This methodology brings tangible advantages for all project stakeholders:

### **For decision-makers and project owners**:
* Clear understanding of the real state of their assets and their potentialities
* Early and concrete visualization of consequences of their strategic choices
* Lasting alignment between strategic vision and concrete realization
* Investment optimization throughout the entire lifecycle
* Rational prioritization of interventions according to their impact and urgency
* Long-term value creation through adaptability and circularity
* Complete documentation facilitating subsequent strategic decisions

### **For designers (architects, engineers)**:
* Deep understanding of existing systems and their performance
* Precise and contextual access to real project owner intentions
* Decision support tools based on capitalized collective experience
* Visualization of impacts of their design choices
* Continuity between different design disciplines
* Simplified integration of circularity considerations
* Reduction of uncertainties related to existing systems

### **For implementers (companies, craftspeople)**:
* Precise knowledge of existing systems and their condition
* Perfectly contextualized technical specifications
* Understanding of intentions that motivate technical choices
* Clear guidance on interfaces between existing and new
* Facilitated integration of reuse elements
* Coherent and unambiguous documentation
* Simplified validation of compliance with requirements

### **For operators**:
* Complete informational continuity from initial intentions
* Deep understanding of technical choices and their motivations
* Structured and contextual documentation of all elements
* Optimized maintenance and evolution strategy
* Facilitation of future adaptations to new needs

# **2. DIGITAL TRANSVERSALITY ONTOLOGY**

## **2.1 Fundamental conceptual structure**

The Digital Transversality ontology simultaneously models the immaterial world (intentional) and the material world (physical), connected by precisely defined pivot concepts. This structure forms the conceptual skeleton on which all processes and methods rest.

### **2.1.1 Immaterial world (intentional)**

**Requirements**: These elements represent the structured formalization of needs arising from strategic intentions. They constitute the highest level of the functional hierarchy and are divided into several categories:

* **Regulatory requirements**: Inescapable legal and normative obligations (accessibility, fire safety, energy performance, etc.)
* **Voluntary requirements**: Certifications, labels, and voluntary standards that the project wishes to satisfy (HQE, BREEAM, LEED, WELL, etc.)
* **Natural requirements**: Intrinsic functional needs arising from intended use (thermal, acoustic, visual comfort, etc.)
* **Circular requirements**: Specifically related to reuse and circular economy (dismantlability, reusability, etc.)

**Capabilities**: Capabilities are the aptitudes required to satisfy requirements. They represent an intermediate level of abstraction between general requirements and concrete means to satisfy them. They are divided into two main categories:

* **Dynamic capabilities**: These capabilities require active information exchanges and regulation or control processes. They generally involve a temporal dimension and information processing (e.g., thermal regulation, presence detection).
* **Static capabilities**: These capabilities rely on passive physical properties, which do not involve dynamic information exchanges (e.g., acoustic insulation, structural resistance).

**Functions**: Functions are atomic actions that break down dynamic capabilities into elementary and indivisible operations. They constitute the most granular level of the dynamic immaterial world. Each function:

* Uses or accesses a data point
* Represents a precise and well-defined action (e.g., measuring a temperature, controlling a lighting level)
* Can be associated with specific performance criteria

**Attributes**: Attributes are the required characteristics that break down static capabilities into measurable properties. They constitute the most granular level of the static immaterial world. Each attribute:

* Is materialized by one or more material characteristics
* Possesses precise and measurable target values (e.g., minimum passage width, fire resistance)
* Can be validated by documentary proofs

### **2.1.2 Material world (physical)**

**Spatial context**: This hierarchical structure organizes the physical spaces of the project at different scales. It constitutes the spatial framework in which intentions are embodied. The spatial context can include:

* **Territories (multi-level)**: From broad territory to plot
* **Building**: The complete built envelope
* **Level**: The different floors or vertical subdivisions
* **Space**: The different rooms or functional zones

**Devices**: Devices are material functional entities that embody the means to respond to requirements. They represent coherent systems that:

* Expose data points for dynamic functions
* Are composed of several physical components
* Constitute the basic functional unit of the material world
* Examples: lighting system, HVAC system, door/opening system

**Components**: Components are the material constituent elements of devices. They represent the most granular level of the physical world and:

* Possess measurable technical characteristics
* Possess specific circularity characteristics
* Are the elements on which concrete technical choices are made
* Examples: luminaire, valve, LED source, detector, panel, frame

**Communicating equipment**: These elements facilitate data communication between the physical world and the digital world. They:

* Allow data points to transit to the digital infrastructure
* Can serve several devices simultaneously
* Ensure the gateway between different protocols
* Examples: BACnet controller, DALI/IP gateway, IoT concentrator

### **2.1.3 Junction elements and key relationships**

**Data points**: They constitute the interface between immaterial functions and material devices. Each data point:

* Is exposed by a specific device
* Is used by a precise function
* Transits through communicating equipment
* Possesses a defined data type and precision
* Examples: measured temperature, gradation level, occupancy state

**Characteristics**: These are the measurable properties of components that:

* Materialize the attributes required by requirements
* Are validated by documentary proofs
* Allow verifying adequacy between needs and solutions
* Examples: CRI of a light source, door width, thermal resistance

**Proofs**: Tangible elements of characteristic validation that can take the form of:

* Technical documents (product sheets, test reports)
* Certifications and labels
* BIM models and technical documentation
* Measurement and verification reports

**Zones**: Pivot concept that connects immaterial capabilities to material spatial context. Zones:

* Apply to spatial context elements
* Contain or carry specific capabilities
* Allow temporal variation of uses (chronotopy)
* Facilitate application of different requirements according to moments and uses

## **2.2 Modeling of circularity characteristics and impacts**

### **2.2.1 Circularity characteristics**

Circularity characteristics constitute a set of measurable properties of components and devices. They play a fundamental role in evaluating circular performance and serve as a basis for estimating influence on different types of impacts.

1. **Reusability**:
   * **Definition**: Capacity of a component to be reused in its original function without major transformation after a first usage cycle
   * **Measurement**: Score from 0 to 10 on a standardized and documented scale
   * **Evaluation criteria**: Aging resistance, interface standardization, preservability
   * **Example**: An LED luminaire with a score of 8/10 indicates that it is easily dismantlable, does not undergo significant degradation during dismantling, and can be reinstalled in another context without major adaptation

2. **Dismantlability**:
   * **Definition**: Ease with which a component can be separated from its assembly without damage to itself or adjacent elements
   * **Measurement**: Score from 0 to 10 on standardized scale
   * **Evaluation criteria**: Type of fastening, accessibility, tools needed, dismantling time
   * **Example**: A removable partition with a score of 9/10 uses only mechanical assemblies without glue or welding, with easily accessible connectors requiring only standard tools

3. **Recyclability**:
   * **Definition**: Potential for transformation into secondary raw material at end of lifecycle
   * **Measurement**: Recyclable percentage and identification of available channels
   * **Evaluation criteria**: Material homogeneity, ease of separation, existence of channels
   * **Example**: An aluminum frame 90% recyclable via an existing and well-documented channel, with recycling processes with low quality loss

4. **Adaptability**:
   * **Definition**: Capacity to adapt to evolving uses without major modification
   * **Measurement**: Versatility score and ease of reconfiguration
   * **Evaluation criteria**: Modularity, compatibility with different systems, evolvability
   * **Example**: A track lighting system with a score of 8/10 allowing easy repositioning of luminaires, intensity adaptation, and evolution of uses without infrastructure modification

### **2.2.3 Impact modeling methodology**

#### **3-layer approach**

Impact modeling relies on a three-level depth approach, enabling complete and rigorous evaluation:

#### Layer 1 - Objective measures
```
# Example: Impact of lighting system on health
{
    "measurement": "salivary_cortisol_concentration",
    "unit": "ng/mL", 
    "value_before": 12.5,
    "value_after": 8.3,
    "improvement": 33.6,
    "confidence": 0.8
}
```

#### Layer 2 - Subjective evaluations  
```
# Example: Well-being perception
{
    "scale": "WHO5_wellbeing",
    "sample": 150,
    "score_before": 6.2,
    "score_after": 8.1, 
    "significance": 0.001
}
```

#### Layer 3 - Systemic emergences
```
# Example: Spontaneous social innovations
{
    "observation": "spontaneous_shared_gardens_creation",
    "frequency": "3_initiatives_in_6_months",
    "impact": "measured_social_cohesion",
    "type": "unplanned_emergence"
}
```

#### **Multi-criteria compilation**

The central algorithm compiles all impacts according to contextual **weighting profiles**:

```
def calculate_global_impact(measurements, stakeholder_profile, project_context):
    """
    Calculate global impact according to stakeholder profile
    """
    weights = get_weights(stakeholder_profile, project_context)
    
    # Compilation by dimension
    eco = compile_economic_impacts(measurements.economic, weights.eco)
    env = compile_environmental_impacts(measurements.environmental, weights.env) 
    soc = compile_social_impacts(measurements.social, weights.soc)
    gen = compile_generative_impacts(measurements.generative, weights.gen)
    
    # Account for interdependencies
    interdependencies = calculate_correlations(eco, env, soc, gen)
    
    return {
        'global_score': weighted_average([eco, env, soc, gen], weights.dimensions) + interdependencies,
        'detail': {
            'economic': eco,
            'environmental': env, 
            'social': soc,
            'generative': gen,
            'synergies': interdependencies
        }
    }
```

#### **Typical weighting profiles**

#### "Traditional investor" profile
```json
{
    "economic": 0.70,
    "environmental": 0.15,
    "social": 0.10,
    "generative": 0.05
}
```

#### "Public authority" profile
```json

{
    "economic": 0.15,
    "environmental": 0.25,
    "social": 0.25,
    "generative": 0.35
}
```

### **2.2.4 Managing interdependencies**

#### **Principle of intersectoral synergies**
Each improvement in one dimension can **generate benefits in other dimensions**. Digital Transversality quantifies these **co-benefits** often invisible in traditional analyses.

#### **Dynamic correlation matrix**
```json
{
  "impact_correlations": {
    "physical_health_to_economic": {
      "coefficient": 0.32,
      "activation_delay": 3,
      "effect_duration": 24,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "mechanism": "Health improvement → Productivity → Savings",
      "context": ["offices", "collaborative_spaces"]
    },
    "social_cohesion_to_security": {
      "coefficient": 0.18,
      "activation_delay": 12,
      "effect_duration": 60,
      "confidence": 0.60,
      "mechanism": "Cohesion → Reduced incivilities → Lower security costs"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Examples of impact cascades**
**Air quality improvement**:
1. **Direct**: Respiratory problem reduction (-15%)
2. **Mental health**: Cognitive capacity (+12%)
3. **Social**: Absenteeism reduction (+8%)
4. **Economic**: Productivity gains (+€180k/year/200 pers)
5. **Generative**: Environmental trust (+25%)

### **2.2.5 Impact evaluation by lifecycle phase**

A major innovation of Digital Transversality lies in systematic impact evaluation at each lifecycle phase:

```
┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐
│  UPSTREAM      │    │ CONSTRUCTION   │    │  OPERATION     │    │  END-OF-LIFE   │

        ▼                     ▼                     ▼                     ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                       IMPACTS IN EACH DIMENSION                                  │
│                                                                                  │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This multidimensional and multiphase analysis allows:

* Avoiding partial optimizations that move problems from one phase to another
* Identifying choices with the most structuring effects on the entire cycle
* Measuring real benefits of circularity on all phases
* Taking into account long-term effects from initial decisions

### **2.2.6 Critical threshold system**

#### **"Red lines" philosophy**
Certain impacts must never fall below **minimum thresholds**, even if other dimensions are excellent.

#### **Threshold typology**

#### Regulatory thresholds (absolute)
```json
{
    "public_health": {
        "indoor_CO2": {"max": 1000, "unit": "ppm", "source": "decree_2012"},
        "ambient_noise": {"max": 35, "unit": "dB(A)", "source": "WHO_2018"}
    },
    "safety": {
        "fire_resistance": {"min": "REI_60", "source": "construction_code"},
        "exit_width": {"min": 0.9, "unit": "m", "source": "ERP_2022"}
    },
    "environment": {
        "energy_performance": {"min_class": "C", "source": "RE2020"}
    }
}
```

#### Ethical thresholds (contextual)
```json
{
    "equity": {
        "PMR_accessibility": {"min": 80, "unit": "%", "context": "public_buildings"},

        "natural_light_access": {"min": 2, "unit": "%_daylight_factor"}
    }
}
```

#### Generative thresholds (evolving)
```json
{
    "mental_health": {
        "chronic_stress": {"max": 0.7, "unit": "normalized_cortisol_index"},
        "environment_satisfaction": {"min": 6, "unit": "scale_1_10"}
    },
    "social_cohesion": {
        "social_isolation": {"max": 0.2, "unit": "proportion_isolated"},
        "neighborhood_conflicts": {"max": 0.1, "unit": "incidents_per_month"}
    }
}
```

### **2.2.7 Mechanism of characteristic influence on impacts**

Circularity characteristics are not simple technical descriptors, but factors that directly influence impacts in all dimensions:

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ CIRCULARITY              │
│ CHARACTERISTICS          │

```

This modeling allows establishing precise causal relationships between the circular characteristics of a component and its impacts at each lifecycle phase, thus facilitating informed arbitration.

### **2.2.8 Evolvability and learning**

#### **Hybrid learning architecture**

The system evolves through **three complementary mechanisms**:

#### 1. Regulatory evolution (automatic)
```python
class RegulatoryUpdate:
    def __init__(self):
        self.monitoring_sources = [
            "official_journal_API",
            "EUR_lex_API", 
            "ADEME_data",
            "WHO_guidelines"
        ]
    
    def check_updates(self):
        """Check daily for new regulations"""
        for source in self.monitoring_sources:
            new_rules = source.get_updates()
            if new_rules:
                self.integrate_automatically(new_rules)
                self.notify_administrators(new_rules)
```

#### 2. Experience feedback learning (semi-automatic)
```python
class ExperienceFeedbackLearning:
    def analyze_completed_project(self, project):
        """
        Analyze a completed project to improve predictions
        """
        gaps = calculate_prediction_reality_gaps(project)
        
        if gaps.significant():
            # Propose model adjustments
            proposed_adjustments = {
                "correlations_to_modify": analyze_correlations(gaps),
                "coefficients_to_adjust": calculate_new_coefficients(gaps),
                "new_synergies_detected": detect_emergences(project)
            }
            
            # Human validation required before integration
            return submit_expert_validation(proposed_adjustments)
```

#### 3. Societal evolution (manual)
```python
class SocietalEvolution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ethics_committee = [
            "environmental_philosopher",
            "urban_sociologist", 
            "citizen_representative",
            "public_health_expert",
            "ecological_economist"
        ]
    
    def annual_values_review(self):
        """
        Democratic review of weightings between values
        """
        citizen_survey = conduct_societal_values_survey()
        trend_analysis = analyze_societal_values_evolution()
        
        evolution_proposal = self.ethics_committee.deliberate(
            citizen_survey, 
            trend_analysis
        )
        
        if consensus_reached(evolution_proposal):
            return integrate_new_weightings(evolution_proposal)
```

### **2.2.9 Granularity adaptation**

#### **Proportionality principle**
Measurement precision adapts to **available means** and **project stakes**.

#### **Adaptation matrix**

#### According to project scale

| Scale | Number of indicators | Main focus | Example |
|-------|---------------------|------------|---------|
| Building < 1000m² | 20 essential indicators | Occupant comfort | Single house renovation |
| Building 1000-5000m² | 50 balanced indicators | Performance + well-being | Office building |
| District 5000-50000m² | 100 complete indicators | Social dynamics | Eco-district |
| Territory > 50000m² | 200+ exhaustive indicators | Systemic transformation | Urban planning |

#### According to project phase

```python
indicators_by_phase = {
    "intention": {
        "type": "prospective",
        "precision": "orders_of_magnitude",
        "method": "analogies_similar_projects",
        "example": "Estimated CO₂ reduction: 30-50%"
    },
    
    "design": {
        "type": "simulated", 
        "precision": "fine_modeling",
        "method": "specialized_software",
        "example": "Simulated CO₂ reduction: 42% ±5%"
    },
    
    "realization": {
        "type": "measured",
        "precision": "real_time_sensors", 
        "method": "dedicated_instrumentation",
        "example": "Measured CO₂ reduction: 38% (first 6 months)"
    },
    
    "operation": {
        "type": "consolidated",
        "precision": "long_term_usage_feedback",
        "method": "multi_year_monitoring",
        "example": "Confirmed CO₂ reduction: 41% (3-year average)"
    }
}
```

## **2.3 Examples of influence relationships**

The relationships between circularity characteristics and impacts are multiple and often complex. Here are some concrete examples:

**Reusability → Upstream environmental impacts**:

* High reusability of a component (score 8+) allows, during its second usage cycle, a 70-90% reduction in primary resource extraction
* This characteristic leads to a proportional decrease in manufacturing carbon footprint
* The effect is particularly significant for materials with high energy intensity (aluminum, steel)

**Dismantlability → Operational economic impacts**:

* High dismantlability (score 8+) typically reduces space reconfiguration costs by 50-80%
* It also reduces maintenance costs because access to internal components is facilitated
* This characteristic increases the possibility of partial upgrading, avoiding complete replacement

**Adaptability → Social and generative impacts**:

* Strong adaptability (score 8+) increases asset value by extending the functional lifespan of the building
* It significantly reduces risks of functional obsolescence facing usage evolution
* This characteristic improves commercial attractiveness through the promise of future evolvability
* It reinforces the value of Freedom by allowing users to adapt their environment according to their needs
* It contributes to the value of Justice through intergenerational equity (non-predetermination of future uses)

**Recyclability → End-of-life economic impacts**:

* High recyclability (>80%) reduces landfill costs that are constantly increasing
* It creates residual value even for non-reusable components
* This characteristic reduces exposure to future taxes on non-recyclable waste

## **2.4 JSON-LD structure of the ontology**

The Digital Transversality ontology is formalized in JSON-LD to enable its integration into the semantic web and facilitate interoperability with other systems. Here are the foundations of this structure:

### **4.1.3 Impact databases**

These databases constitute evaluation repositories structured by impact dimension and lifecycle phase:

**Content**: Evaluation criteria, calculation methods, reference values, relationships between characteristics and impacts, co-benefit matrices

**Usage**: Support for impact evaluation at all project phases, decision aid

**Enrichment**: Update by specialists, calibration on real data, experience feedback

Typical structure of an impact criterion:

## **4.2 Enrichment mechanisms**

### **4.2.1 Continuous learning from projects**

Each project completed using Digital Transversality feeds back into the databases:

**Performance gap analysis**: Systematic comparison between predicted and measured impacts identifies model improvement areas.

**Correlation refinement**: Real data allows refining relationships between circularity characteristics and impacts.

**Method validation**: Successful practices are documented and integrated into standard procedures.

**Innovation capture**: Novel approaches and unexpected solutions are formalized for reuse.

### **4.2.2 Community contribution**

The commons structure enables distributed knowledge enrichment:

**Expert validation**: Domain specialists validate and enrich content in their areas of expertise.

**Manufacturer contribution**: Suppliers provide detailed technical data and real performance feedback.

**User feedback**: Operators and users share usage experience and long-term performance.

**Academic integration**: Research results and studies are integrated to improve scientific foundations.
